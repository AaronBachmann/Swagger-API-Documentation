openapi: "3.0.2"  

#### Add the info object  

The `info` object and its properties contains any important information about the API. The info object may indlude a title, description, contact information, license version, and/or terms of service. Many of the info object properties are optional. In this tutorial the API documentation is written in YAML. YAML indentation requires two-spaces per level of identation. Tabs will not fit the formattin style.
